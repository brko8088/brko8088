# Personal Interests

- My dad got me into Formula 1 ever since I was a little kid, the drama and the technicality of the sport reminds me a lot of the Software Engineering landscape.
- Love cooking, my speciality is soups and steaks.
- According to Steam I've played about 600 hours of Factorio, I also like real time and turn-based strategy games.
